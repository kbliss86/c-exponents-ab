# Exponents / Powers Table

## Objectives:
- User input
- Calculations

## Task:
Display a table of powers (squares and cubes). Ask the user if they would like to go again, and if so, loop back to the beginning.

## What the Application Will Do:
1. **1 Point:** The application prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **3 Points:** The application displays a table of squares and cubes from 1 to the value entered.
3. **1 Point:** The application prompts the user to continue.

## Build Specifications:
- **1 Point:** Assume that the user will enter valid data.
- **1 Point:** The application should continue only if the user agrees to.

## Additional Requirements:
- **1 Point:** Ensure you answer the Lab Summary when submitting to the LMS.
- **-2 Points:** Deduct 2 points if there are syntax errors or the program does not run (for example, in the Main method).

## Hints:
- Be careful to differentiate between squares and cubes.
- Use `\t` to tab and line up columns properly.
- Your instructor will provide sample loops during class regarding how to ask the user if they would like to go again.

## Extra Challenges:
- **1 Point:** Provide validation by rejecting 0 or negative numbers as user input; keep prompting the user until they enter a valid number.
- **1 Point:** Research formatted strings and right-align the numbers in columns instead of left-aligning them.
- **1 Point:** Find out the maximum number whose cube will fit in an `int`, and limit the user input to that number or less.
